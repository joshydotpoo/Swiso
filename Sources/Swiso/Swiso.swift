//  Definitions and Description:
//      - ISO 8211 File Format: Information technology â€” Specification for a data descriptive file for information interchange
//      - The available resources online are awful, the ISO/IEC 8211 file format is old, and apparently the publications cost money.
//      - There were a few resources, linked below that were semi-useful. The GDAL had an actual implemenatation, but it's old code and in C++, so not a lot of translation to Swift.
//      - There's a lot of improvements that could be made, this code isn't optimized and I'm still not sure how to correctly implement the bitstring...so it just gets converted to ascii at the moment. Also, there may be a bug with the multi-dimensional formats (subfields that have a *). Found at least one instance where there weren't enough bytes to fill both columns equally.
